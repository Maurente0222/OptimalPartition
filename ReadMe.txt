The problem and solution are stated in Project2.pdf. 

The code was written in C++. "Dynamic.cpp" reads in "input.txt" which is formatted as follows:
    It begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of problem instances in the Ô¨Åle, p. Each problem instance will specify value of n and t on a line, and the next line will contain n integers representing the array to partition. n is the number of elements in the array, and t is the maximum value that any partition can have. Problem instances will be separated by blank lines.

Compilation:
1) Put input file into same directory as the executable
2) Compile using code in Linux terminal(no quotes): "g++ -Wall Dynamic.cpp"
3) Run with code(no quotes): "./a.out"
4) View output in output.txt
